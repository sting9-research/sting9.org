# Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace Attacks

Cloud productivity platforms—Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace—are critical infrastructure for modern businesses and prime targets for attackers. With 35% of phishing impersonating Microsoft and 71.4% of M365 users experiencing monthly account compromises, securing these platforms is essential.

## The Scale of the Problem

**2024 Statistics:**
- **35% of all phishing** impersonates Microsoft
- **71.4% of M365 users** have compromised account monthly
- **10x surge** in password attacks (30 billion/month)
- **42x increase** in QR code phishing targeting M365
- **$12.5 billion** lost to M365-related attacks
- **Google Workspace:** 15 billion phishing emails blocked daily

## Common Attack Vectors

**Microsoft 365 phishing:**
- Fake Microsoft login pages
- "Your account will be suspended" emails

**Monitoring and alerts:**
- Sign-in logs reviewed regularly
- Unusual activity alerts
- Impossible travel detection
- OAuth app audit
- Data loss prevention policies

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ **35% of phishing** targets Microsoft users
- ✅ **Phishing-resistant MFA** required for all accounts
- ✅ **Conditional access** limits risk-based access
- ✅ **Monitor OAuth apps** for suspicious permissions
- ✅ **QR code phishing** bypasses traditional filters
