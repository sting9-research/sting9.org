# Incident Response and Corporate Policies

Effective incident response and clear security policies are the foundation of organizational resilience. Well-documented procedures, regular training, and practiced response capabilities determine whether incidents are minor disruptions or catastrophic failures.

## Incident Response Framework

**NIST Incident Response Lifecycle:**

**1. Preparation:**
- Incident response plan documented
- Team roles and responsibilities defined
- Tools and access pre-configured
- Contact lists maintained
- Regular training and drills

**2. Detection and Analysis:**
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Threat intelligence integration
- Triage and prioritization
- Initial scope determination
- Evidence collection begins

**3. Containment:**
- Short-term containment (isolate affected systems)
- Long-term containment (temporary fixes)
- Prevent spread to other systems
- Maintain business operations where possible

**4. Eradication:**
- Remove threat from environment
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Reset compromised credentials
- Rebuild compromised systems

**5. Recovery:**
- Restore systems to production
- Monitor for recurrence
- Validate fixes effective
- Return to normal operations

**6. Post-Incident Activity:**
- Lessons learned review
- Documentation updates
- Process improvements
- Communication to stakeholders

## Essential Security Policies

**Acceptable Use Policy:**
- What employees can/cannot do with company resources
- Personal use guidelines
- Prohibited activities
- Monitoring and enforcement

**Email Security Policy:**
- How to handle suspicious emails
- Attachment restrictions
- External email identification
- Reporting procedures

**Wire Transfer/Payment Policy:**
- Verification requirements
- Approval thresholds
- Dual approval procedures
- No exceptions clause

**Remote Access Policy:**
- VPN requirements
- Device security standards
- Acceptable locations
- MFA requirements

**Password Policy:**
- Complexity requirements
- Rotation frequency (or not, if using password manager + MFA)
- Password manager usage
- MFA requirements

**Vendor Management Policy:**
- Security assessment requirements
- Access controls
- Monitoring requirements
- Termination procedures

**Incident Reporting Policy:**
- What constitutes incident
- Who to contact
- Timeline for reporting
- No-blame reporting culture

## Documentation Requirements

**Incident response procedures:**
- Step-by-step playbooks
- Contact information
- Escalation paths
- Communication templates

**Security procedures:**
- Wire transfer verification steps
- Vendor onboarding process
- Access request procedures
- Password reset process

**Training materials:**
- New hire security training
- Role-specific training
- Refresher training content
- Simulated attack exercises

**Audit and compliance:**
- Control documentation
- Evidence of compliance
- Exception tracking
- Remediation plans

## Training and Awareness

**Initial training (onboarding):**
- Overview of threats
- Company policies and procedures
- How to report incidents
- Individual responsibilities

**Role-specific training:**
- Finance: BEC, wire fraud, invoice fraud
- HR: Payroll diversion, credential theft
- IT: Technical threats, system security
- Executives: Whaling, deepfakes, CEO fraud
- All: Phishing, social engineering

**Ongoing training:**
- Quarterly security awareness
- Simulated phishing campaigns
- Tabletop exercises
- Lessons from real incidents

**Measurement:**
- Phishing simulation click rates
- Time to report suspicious emails
- Policy compliance rates
- Training completion rates
- Incident response time

## Communication Plans

**Internal communication:**
- Who needs to know what and when
- Communication channels
- Update frequency
- All-clear notification

**External communication:**
- Customer notification triggers
- Regulatory reporting requirements
- Law enforcement coordination
- Public relations strategy

**Executive reporting:**
- Incident severity levels
- Escalation criteria
- Board notification requirements
- Regular security updates

## Key Takeaways
