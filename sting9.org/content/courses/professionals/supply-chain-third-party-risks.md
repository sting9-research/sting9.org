# Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks

Supply chain attacks exploit trusted vendor relationships to compromise multiple targets simultaneously. The 78% increase in 2024, highlighted by major incidents like Change Healthcare and CrowdStrike, demonstrates how third-party risks can cause catastrophic business disruption.

## The Scale of the Problem

**2024 Major Incidents:**
- **Change Healthcare:** Ransomware affecting millions of patients
- **CrowdStrike update:** Global outage affecting critical infrastructure
- **CDK Global:** Auto dealer software compromise
- **XZ Utils backdoor:** 2.5-year supply chain compromise attempt
- **78% increase** in supply chain attacks overall

## Attack Vectors

**Software supply chain:**
- Compromised updates/patches
- Backdoored libraries/dependencies
- Malicious open-source packages
- Build environment compromise

**Vendor access abuse:**
- Stolen vendor credentials
- Compromised VPN access
- Lateral movement from vendor
- Data theft via vendor access

**Hardware supply chain:**
- Pre-installed malware
- Compromised firmware
- Counterfeit components
- Interdiction attacks

## Third-Party Risk Assessment

**Vendor security evaluation:**
- SOC 2 Type II reports
- Penetration testing results
- Incident response capabilities
- Security training programs
- Insurance coverage

**Access management:**
- Least privilege access only
- Time-limited credentials
- MFA required
- Regular access reviews
- Monitor vendor activity

**Contract requirements:**
- Security standards clauses
- Incident notification requirements
- Right to audit
- Data handling requirements
- Liability provisions

## Protection Strategies

**Vendor management:**
- Risk-based vendor categorization
- Annual security assessments
- Continuous monitoring
- Alternative vendor plans
- Regular contract reviews

**Technical controls:**
- Segment vendor network access
- Monitor vendor connections
- Restrict data access
- Log all vendor activity
- Anomaly detection

**Incident response:**
- Vendor breach notification procedures
- Joint response exercises
- Clear escalation paths
- Regular tabletop exercises

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ **78% increase** in supply chain attacks
- ✅ **Vendor security** is your security
- ✅ **Risk-based assessments** for all vendors
- ✅ **Limit and monitor** vendor access
- ✅ **Contract requirements** for security standards
- ✅ **Incident response plans** include vendor scenarios
