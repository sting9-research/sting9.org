# Payroll Diversion Scams

Payroll diversion attacks target HR and payroll departments with fraudulent requests to change employee direct deposit information. With an 815% increase in attempts, these attacks redirect employee paychecks to criminal accounts before detection.

## The Scale of the Problem

**2024 Statistics:**
- **815% increase** in payroll diversion attempts
- **Proofpoint blocked 35,000** scam attempts in 2024
- **$15M+ stolen** through successful diversions
- **HR/Payroll departments** primary targets
- **Average detection time:** 2-3 pay periods
- **Employee impersonation** via compromised or spoofed email

## How Payroll Diversion Works

**Typical attack:**
1. Scammer researches company employees (LinkedIn, company website)
2. Sends email to HR/payroll impersonating employee
3. Requests direct deposit change with new bank routing/account
4. May include forged authorization documents
5. HR updates payroll system
6. Next paycheck(s) go to scammer's account
7. Employee discovers when paycheck doesn't arrive
8. By then, scammer has withdrawn funds

**Why it works:**
- HR processes many legitimate change requests
- Requests seem routine, not suspicious
- Employees may change banks legitimately
- Scammers spoof employee email addresses
- HR wants to be helpful to employees

## Red Flags

🚩 Request via personal email instead of company email
🚩 Urgent requests "need it by this Friday's payroll"
🚩 New employee requesting change immediately after hire
🚩 Email tone doesn't match employee's typical style
🚩 Unusual timing (right before holidays, large bonus periods)
🚩 Requests to keep change confidential
🚩 Bank account in different state or country than employee

## Verification Procedures

**Mandatory for ALL payroll changes:**

1. **In-person verification:**
   - Employee must appear in person with photo ID
   - Or video call for remote employees (verify face matches ID)
   - Phone call verification minimum (known number)

2. **Separate channel confirmation:**
   - Don't reply to email request
   - Call employee's known phone number
   - Use internal company chat/system
   - Verify through manager if employee unavailable

3. **Documentation requirements:**
   - Voided check from new account
   - Bank letter confirming account ownership
   - Signed authorization form (in person or notarized)
   - Copy of photo ID

4. **Waiting period:**
   - Implement 1-2 pay period delay for changes
   - First payment to new account partial amount only
   - Confirm receipt before full amount

5. **Notification system:**
   - Email/text confirmation to employee's known contact
   - Notify employee when change processed
   - Alert if change request rejected

## Protection Strategies

**HR/Payroll procedures:**
- Never accept email-only requests
- Require in-person or video verification
- Implement waiting periods
- Use secure portals for submissions
- Train staff on social engineering

**Technical controls:**
- Email authentication warnings
- Secure employee self-service portals
- MFA for payroll system access
- Audit logs of all changes
- Alerts for changes before payroll run

**Employee education:**
- How to properly request changes
- Report suspicious change notifications
- Verify paychecks arrive on time
- Monitor bank accounts regularly

**Test transactions:**
- Send $1-10 test payment first
- Confirm employee received it
- Then process full paycheck

## Response to Suspected Fraud

**If fraudulent request detected:**
1. Don't process the change
2. Contact employee immediately via known number
3. Document the attempt
4. Report to IT/security team
5. Warn other HR staff
6. File report with FBI IC3

**If fraudulent payment made:**
1. Contact bank immediately (within 24 hours critical)
2. Request ACH reversal if possible
3. Contact employee to explain situation
4. Issue emergency payment to correct account
5. File police report
6. Report to FBI IC3
7. Review and strengthen procedures
