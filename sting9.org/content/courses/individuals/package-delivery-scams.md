# Package Delivery Scams

In 2024, delivery notification scams increased by 174%, exploiting our reliance on online shopping and package deliveries. These scams impersonate trusted logistics companies to steal personal information, payment details, and credentials.

## The Scale of the Problem

**2024 Statistics:**
- **174% increase** in delivery service smishing
- **USPS** most impersonated carrier (40% of fake messages)
- **$1.99 typical fake "redelivery fee"** to steal payment info
- **26% click-through rate** on fake delivery links
- Messages spike during **holiday shopping seasons** (Nov-Jan)

## Common Delivery Scams

### 1. **Fake Delivery Failure Notices**

Scammers send texts or emails claiming your package couldn't be delivered:

```
USPS: Your package could not be delivered.
Update your address to reschedule delivery:
[shortened link]
```

**Reality:** USPS leaves physical notices and updates via their official app.

### 2. **Redelivery Fee Scams**

Messages claim you need to pay a small fee ($1.99-$3.99) to receive your package:

```
FedEx: Your package is awaiting delivery.
Pay $1.99 redelivery fee here: [link]
```

**Reality:** Legitimate carriers don't charge redelivery fees via text message links.

### 3. **Customs/Tax Payment Scams**

For international shipments, scammers claim customs fees are due:

```
Your package from China is held at customs.
Pay import tax ($35.67) to release: [link]
```

**Reality:** Customs fees are paid through official government websites or at delivery.

### 4. **Package Survey Scams**

Fake surveys about your delivery experience that lead to phishing:

```
How was your Amazon delivery experience?
Take our 30-second survey and get a $50 gift card!
```

**Reality:** Legitimate surveys don't promise rewards or ask for payment info.

### 5. **Delivery Driver Impersonation**

Scammers pose as drivers asking for gate codes, access, or "verification":

```
Hi, I'm your UPS driver. I need your gate code
to deliver your package today. Reply with code.
```

**Reality:** Drivers have access codes provided by facilities or will call officially.

## Red Flags: How to Spot Fake Delivery Messages

🚩 **Unexpected notification** for package you didn't order
🚩 **Shortened URLs** (bit.ly, tinyurl) instead of official domains
🚩 **Payment requests** via text message link
🚩 **Urgent language** ("final attempt," "expires today")
🚩 **Generic greetings** ("Dear Customer" instead of your name)
🚩 **Spelling errors** in company name or message
🚩 **Suspicious sender** (not from official carrier number/email)
🚩 **Requests for sensitive info** (SSN, password, full card number)
🚩 **Prize or reward** for completing survey
🚩 **Pressure to act immediately** without verification

   - USPS: 20-22 digits, starts with 94 or 93
   - FedEx: 12-14 digits
   - UPS: Starts with "1Z"
   - Amazon: TBA followed by 13 digits

### If You're Unsure:

- **Call official customer service** (number from carrier's website, not message)
- **Visit carrier location** with tracking number
- **Check your email** for order confirmations from actual retailers
- **Use official apps** to track all shipments

## Real-World Examples

### **Case Study 1: Holiday Season USPS Scam (December 2024)**

During Black Friday week, scammers sent 2.3 million fake USPS texts:

```
USPS: Your package (tracking: 9400123456789) requires
address update. Confirm here: usps-delivery[.]com/update
```

**Red flags:**
- Domain was `usps-delivery[.]com` (not `usps.com`)
- No package expected
- Tracking number format incorrect
- Asked for SSN and payment info on "verification" page

**Result:** Victims who entered information had identities stolen and bank accounts drained.

### **Case Study 2: Fake Amazon Delivery Survey (Summer 2024)**

Scammers impersonated Amazon with prize survey scams:

```
Your Amazon package was delivered! Rate your
driver and claim your $100 Amazon gift card: [link]
```

**Red flags:**
- Link went to amazon-rewards[.]net (not amazon.com)
- No recent Amazon delivery occurred
- Gift card promise too good to be true
- Asked for credit card for "$1 processing fee"

**Result:** Credit card information stolen, used for fraudulent purchases.

### **Case Study 3: FedEx Redelivery Fee Scam (October 2024)**

Targeted scam during holiday shopping season:

```
FedEx: Delivery attempt failed. Your package
will be returned unless you pay $2.99 redelivery
fee within 48 hours: [link]
```

**Red flags:**
- FedEx doesn't charge redelivery fees
- Urgency ("48 hours")
- Payment link instead of official FedEx site
