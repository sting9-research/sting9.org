# Banking and Financial Scams

Financial scams target your bank accounts, credit cards, and payment apps. This chapter covers how to protect your finances from sophisticated attacks.

## The Financial Fraud Landscape

- **Financial services/SaaS/Webmail**: 23.3% of phishing attacks
- **Banking segment**: 11.9% of attacks in Q3 2024
- **$4.4 billion** lost to payment app fraud in 2024
- **$870 million** lost via Zelle since 2017
- **$2 billion** lost through bank transfers in 2024
- Zelle/Venmo/Cash App payments are **immediate and irreversible**

## Common Banking Scams

### 1. Fake Fraud Alerts

**Example:**
> "Bank Alert: Suspicious $500 charge detected. Call 888-555-0123 immediately to verify."

**Red flags:**
- Phone numbers in messages (banks use known numbers)
- Pressure to call immediately
- Requests to verify by making payments
- Links to click for account access

**What real banks do:**
- Call from known numbers on your card
- Never ask for full account numbers or PINs
- Don't send login links via text/email
- Give you time to verify through official channels

### 2. Account Verification Scams

**The tactic:**
Fake emails/texts claiming your account needs verification or will be closed.

**Red flags:**
- Threats of account closure
- Links to "verify" account
- Urgent 24-48 hour deadlines
- Requests for passwords or PINs

**Protection:**
- Log into your account directly (type URL)
- Call bank using number on your card
- Banks send mail for important changes
- Never verify via email/text links

### 3. "Verify Yourself" Zelle Scams

**How it works:**
1. Scammer initiates Zelle payment TO you
2. You receive verification request
3. Scammer calls pretending to be bank
4. Claims you need to "verify" by sending money back
5. You send money = you just paid the scammer

**Average loss:** Can be thousands of dollars

**Protection:**
- Never "verify" by sending money
- Zelle verification doesn't work this way
- Hang up and call bank directly
- Banks never call asking you to send money
