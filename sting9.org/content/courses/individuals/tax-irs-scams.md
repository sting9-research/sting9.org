for your arrest. Press 1 to speak to an agent."
```

**2. Phishing Emails**
```
Subject: IRS Notice - Refund Approval Required

Verify your bank account details to process
your refund: [link]
```

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ **IRS never initiates contact** via phone, email, text, or social media
- ✅ **IRS never demands** payment via gift cards, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency

- ✅ **Get IP PIN** from IRS for extra filing security
- ✅ **Verify tax preparers:** Check PTIN, credentials, and reviews
