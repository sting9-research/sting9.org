# Email Phishing Scams

Email remains one of the most common attack vectors for scammers. In this chapter, you'll learn to identify phishing emails, understand how attackers craft convincing messages, and protect yourself from this pervasive threat.

## The Scale of Email Phishing

The numbers tell a compelling story:

- **989,123 phishing attacks** observed by APWG in Q4 2024 alone
- **5.3 billion phishing emails** sent daily worldwide
- Microsoft screens **5 billion emails daily** for malware and phishing
- Gmail blocks **100 million phishing emails** every day
- **70% of phishing emails** come from free webmail providers (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
- Phishing is responsible for **44% of recorded data breaches**

Email phishing isn't going away—it's getting more sophisticated and harder to detect.

## Common Email Phishing Tactics

### 1. Account Verification Scams

**The Setup:**
You receive an email claiming your account needs verification or will be suspended.

**Example:**
> Subject: "Urgent: Your PayPal account has been limited"
>
> Dear Customer,
>
> We've detected unusual activity on your account. Click here to verify your identity within 24 hours or your account will be permanently suspended.

**Why it works:**
- Creates urgency and fear
- Exploits trust in familiar brands
- Threatens negative consequences

**Red flags:**
- Generic greetings ("Dear Customer" instead of your name)
- Urgent timeframes (24-48 hours)
- Threats of account suspension
- Links to verify information

### 2. Fake Invoices and Receipts

**The Setup:**
Email appears to be a receipt for a purchase you didn't make, hoping you'll click to dispute it.

**Example:**
> Subject: "Your Amazon order #12345 has shipped"
>
> Thank you for your purchase of Sony Headphones ($299.99). View your order details or cancel if this wasn't you.

**Why it works:**
- You want to check if it's fraudulent
- Creates concern about unauthorized charges
- Looks like legitimate receipts

**Red flags:**
- Order for items you didn't buy
- From email addresses slightly different from official domains
- Links don't match official website URLs
- Poor formatting or grammar

### 3. Prize and Lottery Scams

**The Setup:**
Congratulations! You've won a prize, lottery, or gift card you never entered.

**Example:**
> Subject: "Congratulations! You've won a $500 Amazon Gift Card"
>
> You've been randomly selected as a winner! Claim your prize by clicking here and entering your information.

**Why it works:**
- Exploits desire for free money
- Creates excitement that overrides caution
- Appears to require quick action

**Red flags:**
- Winning contests you never entered
- Requests for personal information to claim prize
- Requires "small processing fee"
- Too good to be true offers

### 4. Banking and Financial Institution Phishing

**The Setup:**
Email appears to be from your bank about suspicious activity or required updates.

**Example:**
> Subject: "Security Alert: Unauthorized login attempt"
>
> We detected a suspicious login from an unknown device. Please verify your account immediately to prevent unauthorized access.

**Why it works:**
- Banking security is important to everyone
- Creates fear of account compromise
- Looks official with logos and branding

**Red flags:**
- Email from addresses not matching bank domain
- Asks you to click links to verify
- Requests sensitive information via email
- Generic account information (not your actual account details)

### 5. Tech Support Scams

**The Setup:**
Email claims to be from Microsoft, Apple, or antivirus companies about security issues.

**Example:**
> Subject: "Microsoft Security Alert: Virus Detected"
>
> Our systems have detected malware on your device. Download this security tool immediately or call our support number.

**Why it works:**
- Fear of computer viruses
- Appears to be helping you
- Uses official-looking branding

**Red flags:**
- Unsolicited security warnings via email
- Phone numbers to call (tech companies don't operate this way)
- Downloadable "security tools"
- Pressure to act immediately

## Major Brand Impersonations

### Microsoft - 35% of All Phishing

Microsoft is the **most impersonated brand** in phishing attacks:

- Fake Office 365 login pages
- "Your password is expiring" emails
- OneDrive file sharing notifications
- Fake account verification requests

**What real Microsoft emails do:**
- Never ask for passwords via email
- Don't send login links
- Use consistent official domains
- Include your actual account information

### Amazon Phishing

Common tactics:
- Fake order confirmations
- "Account on hold" messages
- Prime membership expiration notices
- Package delivery problems

**What real Amazon emails do:**
- Show actual orders in your account
- Use amazon.com domain (not amazon-secure.com)
- Include order numbers you can verify
- Never ask for payment information via email

### Banking Institution Phishing

All major banks are frequently impersonated:
- Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America, etc.
- Credit card companies (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- Payment processors (PayPal, Venmo, Zelle)

**What real banks do:**
- Initial contact via mail, not email
- Never request passwords or full account numbers
- Don't send login links via email
- Use secure messaging within their app/website

## The Anatomy of a Phishing Email

### Red Flag #1: Sender Address

**What to check:**
- Hover over sender name to see actual email address
- Look for slight misspellings (paypa1.com instead of paypal.com)
- Free email providers for "business" emails
- Extra characters or hyphens (pay-pal.com, paypal-secure.com)

**Examples of fake addresses:**
- `support@amazоn.com` (using Cyrillic 'о')
- `noreply@paypal-secure.com`
- `security@microsoft-365.com`
- `alerts@bankofamerica.net` (should be .com)

### Red Flag #2: Generic Greetings

Legitimate companies use your name:
- ❌ "Dear Customer"
- ❌ "Dear User"
- ❌ "Dear Account Holder"
- ✅ "Dear John Smith"

### Red Flag #3: Urgent Language

Scammers create artificial urgency:
- "Act within 24 hours"
- "Immediate action required"
- "Your account will be closed"
- "Verify now or lose access"

**Reality check:** Legitimate companies give reasonable timeframes and multiple notifications.

### Red Flag #4: Suspicious Links

**How to check links safely:**
1. **Hover** over link without clicking (desktop)
2. **Long-press** on link to preview (mobile)
3. **Check** if displayed text matches actual URL
4. **Look for** legitimate domain names

**Example of link mismatch:**
- Displays: "www.paypal.com/verify"
- Actual: "paypal-verify.suspicious-site.com"

### Red Flag #5: Poor Grammar and Spelling

While AI has improved scam writing, mistakes still occur:
- Awkward phrasing
- Inconsistent capitalization
- Spelling errors
- Translation artifacts

### Red Flag #6: Unusual Attachments

Be suspicious of:
- Unexpected attachments from "known" senders
- File types: .exe, .scr, .zip, .js, .iso
- "Invoice.pdf.exe" (double extensions)
- Password-protected documents from unknown sources

### Red Flag #7: Requests for Sensitive Information

Legitimate companies **never** request via email:
- Passwords or PINs
- Social Security numbers
- Credit card numbers (full number)
- Account credentials
- Copies of ID documents

### Red Flag #8: Too Good to Be True

If it sounds amazing, it probably is:
- "You've won $10,000!"
- "Free iPhone for taking survey"
- "Inheritance from unknown relative"
- "Work from home - earn $5000/week"

### Red Flag #9: Mismatched Information

Check for inconsistencies:
- Email says "Your Apple account" but you don't have one
- Bank name you don't use
- Services you've never subscribed to
- Orders you never placed

## Verification Procedures

### Before Clicking ANY Link:

**Step 1: Pause**
Don't click immediately, even if it seems urgent.

**Step 2: Check the Sender**
Verify the actual email address, not just the display name.

**Step 3: Independently Verify**
- Type the company website yourself
- Use official app instead
- Call using phone number from company's official website
- Check your account directly (not through email link)

**Step 4: Look for Red Flags**
Review the checklist above—any red flags?

**Step 5: When in Doubt, Don't**
If something feels off, don't click. Delete it.

### Safe Practices:

**For Important Accounts:**
- **Bookmark** official websites
- Use **official apps** instead of email links
- Enable **two-factor authentication**
- Set up **account alerts** for unusual activity

**For Email Links:**
- Never click links in unsolicited emails
- Type URLs manually
- Use bookmarks for frequent sites
- Verify through independent channels

**For Attachments:**
- Don't open unexpected attachments
- Scan with antivirus first
- Verify sender through alternative method
- When in doubt, ask sender directly (not via reply)

```
