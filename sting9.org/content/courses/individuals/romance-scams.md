# Romance Scams

Romance scams weaponize human emotions, combining social engineering with emotional manipulation to defraud victims. In 2024, these scams resulted in higher average losses than almost any other fraud type, with devastating emotional and financial consequences.

## The Scale of the Problem

**2024 Statistics:**
- **$1.14 billion lost** to romance scams
- **$4,500 median loss per victim** (highest of any scam category)
- **50% of romance scams** start on Facebook or Instagram
- **64,000+ reports** to FTC (2024)
- **70% of victims** are women, but men lose more on average ($3,900 vs $2,500)
- **40% of victims over 60 years old**

## How Romance Scams Work

### **The Typical Progression:**

**Stage 1: First Contact (Week 1)**
- Scammer finds victim on dating app, social media, or messaging platform
- Profile uses stolen photos (often of military personnel, models, or professionals)
- Initial message is personalized, flattering, and seems genuine

**Stage 2: Building Trust (Weeks 2-4)**
- Constant communication (texts, calls, video chats using deepfakes)
- Rapid emotional escalation ("I've never felt this way," "You're my soulmate")
- Shares fabricated personal details to build false intimacy
- Love bombing: excessive affection, future planning, pet names

**Stage 3: Creating Distance (Month 2)**
- Claims to live far away or work overseas
- Excuses for why meeting in person is impossible:
  - Military deployment
  - Working on oil rig
  - Business trip abroad
  - Medical issue preventing travel

**Stage 4: The Ask (Month 2-3)**
- Financial "emergency" arises:
  - Medical emergency for them or family member
  - Business opportunity requiring quick investment
  - Travel expenses to come visit you
  - Legal fees, customs charges, visa costs
- Requests gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency
- May ask victim to receive/forward packages (money mule activity)

**Stage 5: Escalation**
- Initial request is small ($500-$1,000) to test willingness
- Requests increase in frequency and amount
- New crises constantly arise
- If victim expresses doubt, scammer uses guilt, anger, or renewed affection
- Cycle continues until victim has no more money

## Types of Romance Scams

### **1. Traditional Romance Fraud**

Long-term emotional manipulation leading to financial requests.

**Common scenarios:**
- Military romance scams (fake deployed soldiers)
- Overseas worker scams (oil rig, construction, doctor)
- Widower/widow scams (fabricated tragic backstory)

### **2. "Pig Butchering" (Sha Zhu Pan)**

Combines romance with cryptocurrency investment fraud.

**How it works:**
- Scammer builds romantic relationship
- Casually mentions successful cryptocurrency investments
- Offers to "teach" victim how to invest
- Directs victim to fraudulent trading platform
- Victim sees fake profits, invests more money
- When victim tries to withdraw, platform freezes account
- Scammer vanishes with all invested funds

**2024 Impact:**
- **$3.2 billion lost** to pig butchering globally
- **Average loss: $121,000** per victim
- Operations run from Southeast Asia using trafficked workers

### **3. Sextortion**

Scammer develops online relationship, then blackmails victim.

**How it works:**
- Conversation turns intimate/sexual
- Scammer requests explicit photos/videos
- Threatens to share content with victim's contacts unless paid
- Demands payment in cryptocurrency or gift cards

**Reality:** Often the scammer has no actual content; they're bluffing.

### **4. Fake Dating Platform Scams**

Entire dating websites created to facilitate fraud.

**Red flags:**
- Site requires payment before messaging
- Profiles seem too good to be true
- Limited verification processes
- Aggressive monetization (pay per message)

### **5. Inheritance/Windfall Scams**

Scammer claims unexpected wealth but needs help accessing it.

**Common story:**
- Discovered inheritance or business windfall
- Needs victim's help to access funds
- Requests money for legal fees, taxes, or processing
- Promises to share wealth once released

## Verification Procedures

### **Before Trusting an Online Romantic Interest:**

1. **Reverse image search their photos**
   - Use Google Images, TinEye, or PimEyes
   - Upload their profile photos to check if they're stolen
   - Scammers often use photos of models, military personnel, or influencers

2. **Verify their identity**
   - Request video call (live, not pre-recorded)
   - Ask them to send photo holding paper with today's date and your name
   - Check their social media profiles (do they have friends, family, history?)
   - Search their phone number on Google and social media

3. **Watch for consistency**
   - Do their stories match over time?
   - Can they provide specific details about their life?
   - Do they remember things you've told them?

4. **Slow down the relationship**
   - Genuine connections don't require rushing
   - Real people understand if you want to take things slow
   - Scammers will pressure fast emotional commitment

5. **Never send money**
   - Legitimate romantic interests don't ask for money early in relationships
   - No matter the sob story, don't wire money to someone you've never met
   - Never invest money based on online romantic partner's advice

### **If They Request Money:**

- **Do not agree to receive/forward packages** (you could be an unwitting money mule)
- **Save all messages** as evidence
- **Report to the platform** where you met them
- **Report to FTC** and FBI IC3

## Real-World Examples

### **Case Study 1: Military Romance Scam (2024)**

**Victim:** 68-year-old widow in Florida
**Loss:** $2.3 million over 18 months

**The scam:**
- Scammer used photos of real Army general
- Claimed to be deployed in Afghanistan
- Built relationship over 3 months before first money request
- Initial ask: $12,000 for "emergency medical care"
- Escalated to larger amounts for "early retirement processing," "bringing money home from deployment"
- Victim liquidated retirement accounts, took out loans

**Red flags missed:**
- No military member needs civilians to send money
- Army pays for all medical care
- Retirement processing is free for military members
- Real person in photos was easily findable online

**Result:** Victim lost life savings, home foreclosed. Scammer never caught (operated from Nigeria).

### **Case Study 2: Pig Butchering Crypto Romance (2024)**

**Victim:** 42-year-old software engineer in California
**Loss:** $1.8 million

**The scam:**
- Met "successful businesswoman" on dating app
- After 2 months of daily communication, she mentioned her crypto trading profits
- Offered to teach victim her investment strategy
- Directed him to "exclusive" cryptocurrency exchange website
- Victim invested $50,000 initially, saw "profits" grow to $280,000
- Encouraged to invest more; victim sold house, maxed credit cards
- When tried to withdraw, platform demanded 20% "tax" to release funds
- After paying tax, platform went offline, scammer disappeared

**Red flags missed:**
- Cryptocurrency exchange was fake (domain registered 2 weeks before victim joined)
- No legitimate exchange requires upfront "taxes" on withdrawals
- "Profits" were completely fabricated numbers on fake website
- Scammer controlled entire platform

**Result:** Victim lost everything, declared bankruptcy. Platform operators based in Southeast Asia, unreachable.

### **Case Study 3: Sextortion Blackmail (Summer 2024)**

**Victim:** 19-year-old college student
**Initial demand:** $5,000 in Bitcoin

**The scam:**
- Met person on Instagram claiming to be college student from nearby city
- Moved conversation to Snapchat
- Conversation became sexual, victim sent intimate photos
- "Person" immediately demanded payment or would send photos to victim's family and friends
- Showed victim screenshot of their Facebook friends list to prove threat

**Red flags:**
- Relationship escalated to sexual content within hours
- Request for intimate photos early in conversation
- Immediate blackmail after receiving photos

**Result:** Victim reported to police before paying. FBI investigation revealed scammer was part of organized group in Nigeria. Most victims pay initially but demands continue. In this case, reporting prevented payment and scammer moved to other targets.

## Protection Strategies

### **On Dating Platforms:**

1. **Use reputable dating sites/apps**
   - Match, eHarmony, Bumble, Hinge (better verification)
   - Avoid obscure or new dating platforms
   - Check platform's safety features and reporting tools

2. **Protect your privacy**
   - Don't share your last name, address, or workplace early on
   - Don't share financial information
   - Don't connect social media accounts until you've met in person
   - Use different passwords for dating apps

3. **Meet in person early**
   - Suggest meeting in public within first few weeks
   - If they refuse or have constant excuses, that's a major red flag
   - Never send money to someone you haven't met in person

4. **Trust your instincts**
   - If it feels too good to be true, it probably is
   - If you feel pressured, that's a warning sign
   - Talk to friends/family about the person (outside perspective helps)

### **General Protection:**

- **Never send money** to online romantic interests
- **Don't invest** based on online romantic partner's advice
- **Refuse to receive/send packages** for online romantic interests
- **Don't share intimate photos** with people you haven't met
- **Be skeptical** of people who can't video chat or meet in person
- **Do reverse image searches** on all profile photos
- **Tell someone** you trust about your online relationships

### **Red Flag Responses:**

If your online romantic interest:
- **Asks for money** → End contact immediately
- **Can't video chat** after several requests → They're hiding something
- **Won't meet in person** after months → Not genuine
- **Offers investment advice** → It's a scam
- **Love bombs you** immediately → Manipulation tactic
- **Has constant emergencies** → Fabricated sob stories

## What To Do If You're a Victim

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Stop all contact** with the scammer
   - Block them on all platforms
   - Do not respond to future messages
   - They may use guilt or anger to manipulate you further

2. **Stop sending money immediately**
   - Do not send "one more payment"
   - Do not try to "recover" losses by sending more
   - Scammers may pretend to be lawyers/officials offering recovery (another scam)

3. **If money was sent:**
   - **Gift cards:** Contact the company (Amazon, iTunes, etc.) immediately with card numbers
   - **Wire transfer:** Contact your bank and Western Union/MoneyGram

- **RomanceScams.org:** Share your story to warn others

### **Emotional Recovery:**

1. **Don't blame yourself**
   - These are sophisticated criminals

   - Shame prevents reporting; you did nothing wrong

2. **Seek support**
   - Talk to trusted friends or family
   - Consider counseling (many specialize in scam victims)
   - Join support groups (AARP, RomanceScams.org forums)

3. **Be aware of recovery scams**

   - These are secondary scams targeting existing victims

### **Financial Recovery:**

- Check credit reports for unauthorized accounts
- Consider credit freeze if you shared SSN or financial info
- Contact local legal aid about options

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ **Romance scams cost victims $1.14 billion** in 2024
- ✅ **Never send money** to someone you've only met online
- ✅ **Reverse image search** profile photos to check for stolen images
- ✅ **Meet in person early** in public places; endless excuses are red flags
- ✅ **Watch for rapid emotional escalation** and love bombing
- ✅ **Pig butchering scams** combine romance with fake crypto investments
- ✅ **Genuine relationships** don't require rushing or financial assistance
- ✅ **Report scams** to protect others from the same criminal

**Remember:** Real love develops naturally over time and doesn't come with financial demands. If someone you've never met in person asks for money, it's a scam—no matter how genuine the relationship feels. Trust your instincts, and don't let embarrassment prevent you from protecting yourself.
