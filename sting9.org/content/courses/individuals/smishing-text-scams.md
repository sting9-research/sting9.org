# Smishing - Text Message Scams

Smishing (SMS + phishing) has exploded in recent years, with success rates far exceeding email phishing. In this chapter, you'll learn why text message scams are so effective and how to protect yourself.

## The Smishing Threat Landscape

The statistics are alarming:

- **22% increase** in smishing attacks in Q3 2024 alone
- **18% global increase** in smishing incidents in 2024
- **19-36% click-through rate** for smishing (vs. 2-4% for email)
- **27.6% of mobile users** tapped on 6+ smishing links
- **76% of businesses** hit by smishing attacks
- **174% increase** in delivery service smishing scams
- Average loss: **$8,199 per person** for tax-related smishing

## Why Smishing Is More Effective Than Email

### Higher Trust Factor
- Text messages feel more personal
- Less spam than email (historically)
- Mobile notifications create urgency
- Shorter format seems less suspicious

### Mobile Behavior Patterns
- People check phones 96+ times daily
- Respond quickly to texts
- Harder to verify on small screens
- More likely to click on mobile

### Reduced Visibility
- Can't hover over links on mobile (easily)
- Sender spoofing is common
- Shortened URLs hide destination
- Limited context/information visible

### Platform Evolution
Smishing has shifted from traditional SMS:
- **Q2 2024**: 39.6% via KakaoTalk, only 1.5% via traditional SMS
- WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal increasingly targeted
- Harder to filter on messaging apps
- Perceived as more secure platforms

## Common Smishing Tactics

### 1. Fake Delivery Notifications

The **#1 smishing tactic** - 174% increase in 2024.

**Example texts:**
> "USPS: Your package is awaiting delivery. Confirm address: [link]"

> "FedEx: Package held due to incomplete address. Update here: [link]"

> "Amazon: Your order #12345 couldn't be delivered. Reschedule: [link]"

**Why it works:**
- Everyone expects packages
- Creates urgency (package waiting)
- Timed with holidays/shopping seasons
- Links to realistic fake websites

**Red flags:**
- Unexpected delivery notifications
- Requests to click links
- Claims of fees ($1.99 redelivery)
- Urgent action required
- Shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl)

**Verification:**
- Check official app for tracking
- Type carrier website manually
- Verify with retailer directly
- Don't click text links

### 2. Bank Security Alerts

**Example texts:**
> "Bank Alert: Unusual activity detected on account ending in 4567. Verify now: [link]"

> "Your card has been locked due to suspicious activity. Call 888-555-0123 to unlock."

> "Fraud alert: $5 00 transaction declined. Confirm it was you: [link]"

**Why it works:**
- Banking security is critical
- Creates immediate concern
- Appears official with account details
- Time-sensitive nature

**Red flags:**
- Links to "verify" account
- Phone numbers to call (not from your card)
- Requests for PIN or password
- Generic account info (last 4 digits could be guessed)

**What real banks do:**
- Use official app notifications
- Call from known bank numbers
- Never ask for PIN/password via text
- Provide ways to verify in-app

### 3. "Verify Your Account" Messages

**Example texts:**
> "PayPal: Your account has been limited. Verify identity: [link]"

> "Apple: Your iCloud account requires verification within 24 hours."

> "Netflix: Payment method failed. Update billing info: [link]"

**Why it works:**
- Account suspension is concerning
- Urgent timeframes
- Familiar services everyone uses

**Red flags:**
- Account services you use sending texts unexpectedly
- Links to "verify" or "update"
- Threats of suspension
- 24-48 hour deadlines

**Verification:**
- Log into account directly (app or browser)
- Check for actual notifications there
- Contact company via official channels
- Never click text message links

### 4. Toll Road and Traffic Scams

**Example texts:**
> "E-ZPass: You have an unpaid toll of $12.51. Pay now to avoid $50 fine: [link]"

> "Tollway Notice: Outstanding balance of $3.75. Pay within 72 hours: [link]"

**Why it works:**
- Specific to your geographic region
- Realistic amounts ($3-15)
- Threat of escalating fines
- Many people use toll roads

**Red flags:**
- Texts about tolls (most use mail)
- Immediate payment demands
- Links to pay
- "Fines" for small amounts

**Verification:**
- Log into official toll account
- Check statements there
- Toll agencies send mail first
- Never pay via text link

### 5. Two-Factor Authentication Scams

**Example texts:**
> "Your verification code is 123456. Never share this code."

Followed by phishing call:
> "This is [Bank] security. We need that code you just received to verify it's you."

**Why it works:**
- Legitimate codes look the same
- Creates confusion
- Urgent phone call adds pressure
- Exploits security features

**Red flags:**
- Unsolicited 2FA codes (you didn't request)
- Anyone asking for your 2FA code
- Phone calls about codes
- Multiple codes in short period

**What to do:**
- Never share 2FA codes
- Ignore unsolicited codes
- Hang up if asked for codes
- Change passwords if receiving unexpected codes

### 6. COVID and Health-Related Scams

While declining, still prevalent:

**Example texts:**
> "You've been exposed to COVID-19. Schedule free test: [link]"

> "Vaccine appointment available. Confirm within 2 hours: [link]"

**Why it works:**
- Health concerns override caution
- Government/health authority impersonation
- Urgent medical nature

**Red flags:**
- Unexpected health notifications via text
- Links to schedule appointments
- Requests for insurance info
- Payment for "free" services

### 7. Prize and Gift Card Scams

**Example texts:**
> "Congratulations! You've won a $500 Walmart gift card. Claim here: [link]"

> "You've been selected for Amazon rewards program. Click to redeem: [link]"

**Why it works:**
- Everyone likes free money
- Appears randomly selected
- Quick claim process
- No obvious harm in checking

**Red flags:**
- Winning contests you never entered
- Free money offers
- Links to "claim"
- Time-limited offers

## Shortened URLs: The Smishing Weapon

### Why Scammers Use Them
- Hide actual destination
- Look less suspicious
- Bypass some filters
- Can track clicks

### Common URL shorteners:
- bit.ly
- tinyurl.com
- goo.gl
- t.co
- ow.ly

### How to check shortened URLs:
1. Use URL expander services (getlinkinfo.com, urlex.org)
2. Never click first - expand first
3. Look for the actual destination domain
4. If suspicious, don't click at all

## Geographic Targeting

Smishing campaigns often target specific regions:

**Regional toll road scams:**
- E-ZPass (Northeast US)
- FasTrak (California)
- SunPass (Florida)
- TxTag (Texas)

**Local government impersonation:**
- State DMV messages
- Local utility companies
- Regional delivery services

**Why geographic targeting works:**
- More believable (services you actually use)
- Realistic context
- Harder to fact-check quickly

## Platform-Specific Smishing

### Traditional SMS
- Direct carrier messages
- Can spoof sender names
- Harder to block at scale

### WhatsApp/Telegram/Signal
- Appear more trustworthy
- Group message scams
- Forwarded message chains
- Fake business accounts

### iMessage
- Difficult to spoof from iPhone users
- Green bubble (SMS) vs. blue (iMessage) confusion
- FaceTime phishing attempts

## Mobile-Specific Vulnerabilities

### Why Mobile Makes You Vulnerable

**Limited screen space:**
- Can't see full URLs
- Less context visible
- Harder to spot details

**Tap-to-action mentality:**
- Designed for quick interactions
- Less deliberate decision-making
- Muscle memory clicking

**Notification urgency:**
- Push alerts create pressure
- Fear of missing something
- React before thinking

**Harder verification:**
- Switching apps cumbersome
- Can't hover over links
- Copy-pasting URLs difficult

## Verification Procedures for Text Messages

### Golden Rule: Never Click Links in Texts

**Instead:**

1. **Open official app** - For the service mentioned
2. **Type URL manually** - In your browser
3. **Call official number** - From company website/card
4. **Visit in person** - For local services

### Before Any Action:

**Ask yourself:**
- Was I expecting this message?
- Does this company text me normally?
- Is there urgency/threat language?
- Am I being asked to click a link?
- Does the number look official?

**If any answer is "yes" to red flag questions:**
Don't click. Verify through official channels.
