## Verification Procedures

### **Before Purchasing:**

1. **Research the website/seller:**
   - Google the site name + "scam" or "reviews"
   - Check domain age: WHOIS.net (brand new = red flag)
   - Look for independent reviews (not on their site)
   - Check Better Business Bureau (BBB.org)
   - Search for physical address on Google Maps

2. **Verify contact information:**
   - Look for phone number and physical address
   - Call the number to verify it's real
   - Check if address is residential or commercial

3. **Check for security:**
   - HTTPS (padlock icon in browser)
   - Secure payment processor (not just bank transfer)
   - Privacy policy and terms of service
   - Verified badges (if applicable)

4. **Reverse image search:**
   - Use Google Images, TinEye
   - See if product photos are stolen from other sites
   - Stock photos used across multiple sketchy sites = scam

5. **Compare prices:**
   - Check same product on Amazon, eBay, official retailer
   - If price is 50%+ below everywhere else, be very suspicious
   - "Too good to be true" usually is

6. **For social media/marketplace:**
   - Check seller's profile and history
   - Look for reviews/ratings
   - Meet in person for local sales (public, safe location)
   - Use platform's payment system (buyer protection)
   - Never wire money or send gift cards

### **Safe Payment Methods:**

- ✅ **PayPal Goods & Services** - buyer protection (not Friends & Family)
- ✅ **Platform payment systems** (eBay, Etsy built-in checkout)

**Limited or no protection:**
- ⚠️ **Debit cards** - less fraud protection than credit cards
- ⚠️ **Venmo/Zelle/Cash App** - no buyer protection for purchases
- ❌ **Wire transfer, gift cards, cryptocurrency** - untraceable, no recourse

**Never pay via:**
- Gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, etc.)
- Wire transfer (Western Union, MoneyGram)
- Cryptocurrency
- Payment apps set to "Friends & Family"

### **Red Flags to Walk Away:**

If seller or website:
- Only accepts untraceable payment
- Pressures immediate purchase
- Won't provide additional photos/proof
- Has just-created account/domain
- Offers luxury goods at impossible prices
- Has no contact information
- Site is nearly identical to other suspicious sites

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ **$11 billion lost** to online shopping fraud in 2024
- ✅ **BogusBazaar: 75,000+ fake websites** operated as massive scam network
- ✅ **Extreme discounts (70-90% off) are almost always scams**
- ✅ **Use credit cards** for best fraud protection when shopping online
- ✅ **Verify website legitimacy:** Check domain age, reviews, contact info
- ✅ **Meet in person** for local marketplace purchases
- ✅ **Never pay with gift cards, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency**
- ✅ **If it seems too good to be true, it absolutely is**

**Remember:** Legitimate retailers rarely offer extreme discounts (70-90% off). Always verify website authenticity before entering payment information.

A few minutes of research before purchasing can save hundreds or thousands of dollars.
