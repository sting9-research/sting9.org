# Cryptocurrency and Investment Scams

Cryptocurrency and investment scams combine financial exploitation with technological confusion, targeting both experienced investors and newcomers. The irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes these scams particularly devastating.

## The Scale of the Problem

- **$14,129 median loss** per victim (crypto)
- **169% increase** in fake crypto investment apps
- **Younger victims:** 40% of crypto scam victims are 20-39 years old

**Why Crypto Scams Are Particularly Dangerous:**

- **Anonymous** criminals (difficult to trace)
- **Unregulated** in many jurisdictions
- **Complex** technology confuses victims
- **FOMO** (fear of missing out) drives impulsive decisions

## Types of Cryptocurrency and Investment Scams

### **1. Fake Cryptocurrency Exchanges and Wallets**

**The Scam:**
- Professional-looking crypto trading platform or wallet app
- Appears in app stores or via online ads

🚩 **Lack of transparency:**
- Anonymous team or fake identities
- No verifiable company information

🚩 **Technology claims:**
- Revolutionary technology that's never explained
- Buzzwords without substance (AI, blockchain, quantum)

- No working product despite promises

🚩 **Communication red flags:**

- Not listed on CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko

## Verification Procedures

### **Before Investing in Cryptocurrency:**

1. **Research the platform:**
   - Check company registration and licensing
   - Verify team members (LinkedIn, previous work)
   - Read independent reviews (not from their website)
   - Check CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko for legitimate exchanges
   - Search "[platform name] scam" to see warnings

2. **Use only established exchanges:**
   - **Major exchanges:** Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Binance.US
   - Regulated and licensed in your jurisdiction
   - Have track record and user protection
   - Never use exchange recommended by stranger

3. **Verify regulatory compliance:**
   - Check FinCEN (U.S.) or local financial regulator
   - Legitimate exchanges are registered as MSBs
   - Investment platforms must be SEC-registered (U.S.)

4. **Test with small amount first:**
   - Start with minimum investment
   - Verify you can withdraw before investing more
   - Many scams allow small initial withdrawals to build trust

5. **Never share private keys or seed phrases:**
   - Legitimate platforms never ask for these
   - Anyone with your keys can steal all your crypto
   - "Not your keys, not your crypto"

### **Red Flags in Investment Offers:**

Ask yourself:
- Do I fully understand how returns are generated?
- Is this licensed/registered with financial regulators?
- Can I verify the people behind this?
- Am I being pressured to invest quickly?
- Does this sound too good to be true?

**If you can't answer these confidently, don't invest.**

### **Verify Celebrity Endorsements:**

- Check celebrity's verified social media accounts
- Real celebrities rarely endorse specific crypto investments
- No legitimate "giveaways" that require sending crypto first
- Deepfake technology makes video "proof" unreliable

### **For Trading Bots and Advisors:**

- Never give API access with withdrawal permissions
- Research advisor's credentials (SEC registration, CFP, etc.)
- Be skeptical of 100% win rates or guaranteed returns
- Test with paper trading or minimal funds first

### **Emotional Recovery:**

- Don't blame yourself (these are sophisticated criminals)
- Seek counseling if needed
- Join support groups (r/scams, BehindMLM forums)

- "Regulators" requiring payment to unfreeze accounts

**99.9% of these are scams.** They're targeting you because they know you're vulnerable.

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ **Crypto transactions are irreversible** - once sent, funds are gone
- ✅ **Use only established, regulated exchanges** (Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini)
- ✅ **Never share private keys or seed phrases** with anyone
