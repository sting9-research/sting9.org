# What To Do If Targeted or Compromised

Despite our best efforts, anyone can fall victim to a scam or have their information compromised. What matters most is how quickly and effectively you respond. This chapter provides a comprehensive, step-by-step action plan for different scenarios.

## Important Mindset: Don't Panic, But Act Fast

**Key principles:**
- ✅ **Time is critical:** Faster response = better chance of limiting damage
- ✅ **Don't feel ashamed:** Scammers are professionals; anyone can be targeted
- ✅ **Action over blame:** Focus on damage control, not self-criticism
- ✅ **Document everything:** Save all evidence
- ✅ **Report widely:** Help authorities stop scammers
- ✅ **Be realistic:** Some losses are unrecoverable, focus on preventing further damage

**Reporting helps:**
- Stop scammers from targeting others
- Build law enforcement cases
- Help payment processors identify fraud patterns
- May be required for insurance/tax deductions

   - Most money is picked up within hours
   - Once picked up, essentially unrecoverable

**Bank Wire Transfer:**

1. **Call your bank immediately**
2. **Request recall:**
   - If to domestic bank, may be recalled if not yet credited
   - International wires nearly impossible to recall

3. **Success rate:**

## Recovery Scams (Don't Be Victimized Twice)

**After losing money, beware of:**

**"Recovery services" offering to get your money back:**

- Request upfront fees ($500-$5,000)
- Almost always scams

**"Lawyers" or "investigators":**
- Cold call offering assistance
- No lawyer requires payment before services
- Verify credentials with state bar

**"Government officials":**
- Claim you need to pay fees/taxes to unfreeze accounts
- Real government agencies don't work this way

- Illegal and ineffective
- Will take your money

**"Refund" scams:**
- Scammer contacts you offering refund
- Needs your bank info or wants you to pay processing fees

**Reality:** If someone promises they can definitely recover your lost funds (especially crypto, wire transfers, gift cards), they're scamming you again.
